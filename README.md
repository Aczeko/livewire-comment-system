## üîé Overview

This is a drop-in comment system built with Livewire, that works for any model.

You can create comments, reply to them, and edit and delete the comments you made. It's using Alpine.js to minimise network requests, by building an Alpine.js directive to display when a comment was posted, handling deleted users and loading more comments gradually.

The Livewire comments component can then be dropped wherever it's needed and the comments will instantly be enabled.
